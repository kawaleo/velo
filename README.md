# Velo

A programming language made in my spare time

> Note: If you would like to contribute, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Introduction

velo is designed to be a simple and easily maintainable general purpose programming language similar to those of `javascript` and `python`

> But why?<br>I created velo to teach myself how to write an interpreter<br>But still, why?<br>I guess I got bored

## Compiling from Source

### Requirements

velo assumes the following packages are installed

- `cargo` and `rustc`
- `git` (in order to clone repo)
